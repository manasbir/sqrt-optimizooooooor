exceptions to the rule that x^2 in binary.length()/2 == x in binary.length()
is only off by one, so its probably just a rounding deal
its not an issue bc the rounding is correct, just that these are odd numbers
so we could say this rule is true

solidity will always round down though
making this for the large part good
